# VISUALIZING: Earthquake Data

## ABOUT

In this exercise, you can visualize earthquakes around the world. As well as tectonic plates*. 

<br>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides earthquake data in several different formats, updated every 5 minutes: [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). For this exercise, the data correspond to the seismic activity registered in the last 7 days: [USGS GeoJSON 7 Days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson)

<br>*Tectonic plates or lithospheric plates are the different fragments into which the Earth's lithosphere is divided, that is, the most superficial layer of the planet, where the crust and the upper part of the Earth's mantle are included. At its edges, seismic, volcanic and orogenic activity is concentrated.
